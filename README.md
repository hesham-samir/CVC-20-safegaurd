# Project Description:
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell. 
Due to the widely spread pandemic, precautions have been taken to protect people from getting infected including wearing face masks, frequently wash hands, and most importantly, staying at home.
Despite of these advices, some people still have to go to work and spend hours outside their houses which makes them more prone to infection. Also, studies have shown that a regular person touches his face approximately sixteen times per hour. We touch our faces so often that the odds of recontamination of our hands between washings are extremely high.
Therefore, our project aims to increase awareness about the basic protective precautions that should be taken to protect people from the Corona virus. The model checks whether a person is wearing a mask or not and warns a person if he tries to touch his face
